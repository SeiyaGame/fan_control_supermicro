# Fan Control Script for Supermicro

## Resources

- [Supermicro X9/X10/X11 Fan Speed Control](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?resources/supermicro-x9-x10-x11-fan-speed-control.20/)

## Description

This Python script is designed to automatically control the fan speeds of a server based on the temperatures of the hard drives and the CPU. It uses IPMI tools to adjust fan speeds in response to temperature changes, ensuring optimal cooling and performance of the server.

## Features

- Dynamically adjusts fan speeds based on HDD and CPU temperatures.
- Customizable temperature thresholds for different fan speeds.
- Supports different zones (CPU and peripheral) for targeted cooling.
- Dry run mode for testing without applying changes.
- Continuous monitoring with adjustable loop sleep time.

## TODO

- [x] Setting up logs
- [ ] Create a web interface to display temperature data ??
- [ ] Setup a Prometheus exporter??
- [ ] Restrict this script to only works on DEBIAN and TrueNAS SCALE

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Access to IPMI on the server.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your server.  
Install ipmitool on your server or ensure it's already installed ( Debian default path : `/usr/bin/ipmitool`)  

Then Clone the project on your folder : `git clone https://github.com/SeiyaGame/fan_control_supermicro.git`

Or download the script and run it :

> [!NOTE]
> Run the script at your own risk !

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeiyaGame/fan_control_supermicro/main/install_script.sh
chmod +x install_script.sh && ./install_script.sh
```

Finally, you can edit the variables in the file `fan_control_script.py` and then start the service: `service fan-control start` or run the script `python3 fan_control_script.py`

## Usage

1. Configure the fan speed grids (**disk_fan_speed_grid** and **cpu_fan_speed_grid**) as per your requirements.
2. Run the script: `python3 fan_control_script.py`
3. Optionally, enable dry run mode by adding `-d` or `--dry_run` to test without applying changes.
4. Optionally, you can send logs message to a discord webhook by editing variables in the file `fan_control_script.py` or by adding `--discord_webhook 'YOUR_URL'`

### Output in your console

```bash
Fan mode set to FULL
Set fan speed for the peripheral zone to 70% (0x46) (Temperature range: 35 â†’ 37)
Set fan speed for the cpu zone to 45% (0x2d) (Temperature range: 26 â†’ 34)

```

## Configuration

- Fan Speed Grids: Adjust the temperature ranges and corresponding fan speeds in the script.
- Loop Sleep Time: Set the time interval between each monitoring loop.

## Limitations

- Currently, supports only Debian-based systems and TrueNAS Scale. (planned to restrict)
- Does not include a web interface or Prometheus exporter (planned for future updates).
